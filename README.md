# COVIDTRAP
  
  _We are_ Biotechnology students at the Federal University of Amazonas. 
  
  **Our team** is led by two members of the Amazonas Synthetic Biology Hub.  
  
  **Our proposal** is to create a biosensor that can detect Sars-Cov-2 spike protein in patient's samples as a way to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID19 in the state of Amazonas.
